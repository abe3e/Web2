            Yummi really, really, REALLY likes to climb on everything. It's a like, nice because yay she's ok 
            with jumping around, but also, not nice because she then teaches her siblings. This is why Miko 
            is getting onto high areas and can't come down. Honestly, whenever she gets off of high
            places she full sends it. Luckily we're always watching just in case she can't get down, but she's
            the reason my room is like a jungle gym.
