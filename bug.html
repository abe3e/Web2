            Bug is like....weird but in a cute way. He loves being held and will yell at you if you don't give him 
            what he wants! If he really really really needs you, he will climb up onto your pants to try to 
            reach your face just so he can stare at you. I think he thinks he's a WWE fighter with the way he's 
            always jumping the girls, but they usually win.
